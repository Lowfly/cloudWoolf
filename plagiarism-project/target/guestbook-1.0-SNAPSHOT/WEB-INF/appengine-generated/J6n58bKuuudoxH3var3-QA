Cloud Challenges
CO846 Cloud Computing Assignment 1

Introduction
Cloud computing is a past dream that has nowadays came into reality (Sourabh, 2014) (Armbrust, et al., 2009). The actual idea to use computing as a utility was first introduced in the 1960s (Parkhill, 1966). This report will analyse the meaning of Cloud Computing as a terminology, present a record of some of its many uses. Moreover, examples of specific companies will be described. Last but not least, the report will mention some of the challenges this architecture has in both research and commercial views, explaining two of these.

b. You (person A) send a digitally signed email to someone else in the class (person B). Get person B to digitally sign and forward the signed email to someone else in the class (person C), first as an “inline” message and then as an attachment. See if person C can read the signatures of person B and person A.
Amazon started sharing their computing technology via the Amazon Web Services (AWS). These services provide a handful of APIs to developers to use their infrastructure according to their needs, paying a fee on demand. The most known services of Amazon is Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which is using the Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs) into the Amazon Simple Storage Service (AS3) (The Next Wave, 2009). There, the data are stored as β€objectsβ€ of 1B to 5GB, which are grouped in β€bucketsβ€ (Zhang, et al., 2010).
The EC2 offers virtualization of Amazon-managed machines that developers can use to run their own software environments and applications. In the beginning, an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) is created. This contains the necessary software and information, such as an operating system, custom configuration settings and libraries. Next, this AMI gets a unique identifier, when it gets loaded to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (AS3). The user can then run as many instances as they like using this identifier (The Next Wave, 2009).
Amazon bills users according to their needs. For example, a small AMI which has less memory, computing power and small storage capacities costs less than a bigger one, because the cost is relevant to the features that the instance is using (The Next Wave, 2009). The communication with Amazon Web Services is done via HTTP calls, with REST and SOAP protocols (Sosinsky, 2011).
Amazon has researched ways to make their approach more efficient, such as creating Availability Zones which will serve usersβ€™ applications, according to the distributed regions. This way they
become more geographically distributed, and achieve higher fault tolerance (The Next Wave, 2009). Users can choose one Region to create their buckets of objects, in order to improve their services (Zhang, et al., 2010).
Some of the available systems that an AMI image can support are OpenSuse Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Debian and Windows Server 2003/2008 32-bit and 64-bit. Security is achieved with passwords, Kerberos tickets or certificates.
Microsoftβ€™s Cloud Services
On the other hand, Microsoft not only provides computing power and storage capacities, but they also offer the ability to their users to access applications that are already developed in the cloud (Zhang, et al., 2010). This is done by Microsoftβ€™s Azure Services Platform which was introduced in 2008 (Sosinsky, 2011).
Windows Azure is a cloud operating system that supports SQL Azure, SharePoint Services, Azure Dynamic CRM, .NET and Microsoft based services. It also consists of a set of virtual machines called β€Computeβ€ and a high capacity storage called β€Storageβ€ (Sosinsky, 2011).
The supported languages on Azure are C#, Visual Basic, C++ (Zhang, et al., 2010). Azure stores the data are stored in blobs, tables and queues. Blobs can have a maximum of 50GB and are saved in tables, different than the SQL-like tables. The language used to access these tables is called Microsoft Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax query language. Data are saved in three different replicas to improve fault tolerance. Like Amazonβ€™s Web Services, the communication in Microsoft Azure is also done via HTTP or HTTPS calls, using REST protocol. However, in comparison with the Amazonβ€™s AMIs, Azureβ€™s users cannot supply their own VM image (The Next Wave, 2009).
Windows Azure also supports Windows Live Services and Windows Live for Mobile applications. The company tries to push software in terms of both applications and services. This way they can benefit of a Microsoft store that sells cloud applications. In addition, .NET has evolved in order to be able to extend parts, or entire applications directly to the cloud. This service is called Azure AppFabric (Sosinsky, 2011).
Part C: Cloud Computing Challenges
As in every new technology that appears, there are challenges associated with Cloud. These can be distinguished in research and commercial aspects.
Challenge in research
One of the main considerations in Cloud Computing research is the actual performance. It is difficult to achieve high performance while writing software for a parallel or distributed system (The Next Wave, 2009). The reason that this happens is the complexity of states and the dependencies between data in applications. Thus, it is hard to predict how many processing power a user needs before executing an application, because this can be achieved only with human interaction and experience (Dillon, et al., 2010).
