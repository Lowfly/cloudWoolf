Cloud Challenges
CO846 Cloud Computing Assignment 1

Introduction
Cloud computing is a past dream that has nowadays came into reality (Sourabh, 2014) (Armbrust, et al., 2009). The actual idea to use computing as a utility was first introduced in the 1960s (Parkhill, 1966). This report will analyse the meaning of Cloud Computing as a terminology, present a record of some of its many uses. Moreover, examples of specific companies will be described. Last but not least, the report will mention some of the challenges this architecture has in both research and commercial views, explaining two of these.
Part A: What is Cloud Computing
Within the years, Computing infrastructures have evolved rapidly. The figure in the left (Figure 1) represents these infrastructures. It is noticeable that Cloud computing reminds of the original mainframe computing paradigm. However, the most significant difference is that Cloud Computing provides the illusion of infinite resources, both in aspects of computing power ursus nec nunc ac, bibendum efficitur neque. Mauris condimentum sit amet nulla a and storage (Furht & Escalante, 2010).
In addition to the above, the basic characteristic of Cloud Computing is abstraction and virtualization: using the internet through transparent and consistent communication standards to access resources pooled and partitioned as needed (Sosinsky, 2011). This makes Cloud Computing flexible and elastic which benefits the companies because they use only the necessary resources according to their current needs (Hurwitz, et al., 2012). On other words, Cloud Computing serves software and hardware resources via the Internet, providing on-demand data storages, computing power, broad network access, and services from external sources. (Sourabh, 2014).
The aforementioned on-demand self service provides to customers, or companies the ability to request and manage their own computing resources.

By pooled resources it is considered that customers can access a pool of computing resources, which are placed in remote data centres. (Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, 2011)

These services are divided to the following layers as presented in Figure 2 from subset to superset. First, is the Infrastructure as a Sursus nec nunc ac, bibendum efficitur neque. Mauris condimentum sit amet nulla a ervice (IaaS) layer, which provides the necessary virtual hardware such as virtual machines, virtual storage and virtual infrastructure. Next, layer is the Platform as a Service (PaaS) one, which offers infrastructure and application alongside. Last but not least, the Software as a Service (SaaS) layer serves software to the cloud costumeursus nec nunc ac, bibendum efficitur neque. Mauris condimentum sit amet nulla a rs. (Sosinsky, 2011)

The next figure represents the usages of every Cloud Computing Service according to each role.
Figure 3: Cloud services and cloud roles (Furht & Escalante, 2010)
There is also distinguishing between the different scopes that these services can be located. Private Clouds are used exclusively by a specific organisation, whereas Public Clouds are available for the general public and provided by a company that offers cloud services. Moreover, community cloud is a serves several organisations. Finally, Hybrid Cloud describers the combination of any of the above (Huth & Cebula, 2011).
Cloud Computing Usages
According to the aforementioned architecture and advantages that Cloud Computing provides, five usages of this technology are listed below:
ο‚· One of the most common of Cloud Computing services is the computing power. This is provided by the IaaS layer and is usually charged ursus nec nunc ac, bibendum efficitur neque. Mauris condimentum sit amet nulla a per CPU per hour. For instance, a designing company could use such services to rent many CPUs working for a specific time. Thus, it will avoid the time of a single machine to complete rendering (Sosinsky, 2011).
ο‚· Another popular use of Cloud Computing is that of the storage. It is also part of the IaaS layer and charged per capacity per time. Individuals can always benefit of using extra storage. Thus, they can save their work and access it from everywhere, without the need of carrying any storage device (Sosinsky, 2011).
ο‚· Using the cloud might also be convenient for developers in order to share applications. For example, a program can be hosted on the cloud, allowing other developers to access it, regardless of the software that they use (Sosinsky, 2011).
ο‚· Since rending a simple virtual machine is chargedursus nec nunc ac, bibendum efficitur neque. Mauris condimentum sit amet nulla a  according to the userβ€™s needs and does not require up-from investments, small start-up companies can experiment in their products, without having to buy any expensive hardware or software (Furht & Escalante, 2010).
ο‚· On the platformβ€™s layer there are set of tools and utilities that a developer can use. Such tools are testing, profiling, versioning, database and Web service integration, as well as storage tools (Sosinsky, 2011).
Part B: Cloud Computing Examples
In this chapter the report focuses on to Cloud Computing providers, Amazon and Microsoft. There is a brief description of their cloud services architecture, and a comparison between them.
Amazonβ€™s Cloud Services
Amazon started sharing their computing technology viaursus nec nunc ac, bibendum efficitur neque. Mauris condimentum sit amet nulla a  the Amazon Web Services (AWS). These services provide a handful of APIs to developers to use their infrastructure according to their needs, paying a fee on demand. The most known services of Amazon is Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which is using the Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs) into the Amazon Simple Storage Service (AS3) (The Next Wave, 2009). There, the data are stored as β€objectsβ€ of 1B to 5GB, which are grouped in β€bucketsβ€ (Zhang, et al., 2010).
The EC2 offers virtualization of Amazon-managed machines that developers can use to run their own software environments and applications. In the beginning, an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) is created. This contains the necessary software and information, such as an operating system, custom configuration settings and libraries. Next, this AMI gets a unique identifier, when it gets loaded to the Amazon Simple Storage Service (AS3). The user can then run as many instances as they like using this identifier (The Next Wave, 2009).
Amazon bills users according to their needs. For example, a small AMI which has less memory, computing power and small storage capacities costs less than a bigger one, because the cost is relevant to the features that the instance is using (The Next Wave, 2009). The communication with Amazon Web Services is done via HTTP calls, with REST and SOAP protocols (Sosinsky, 2011).
Amazon has researched ways to make their approach more efficient, such as creating Availability Zones which will serve usersβ€™ applications, according to the distributed regions. This way they
become more geographically distributed, and achieve higher fault tolerance (The Next Wave, 2009). Users can choose one Region to create their buckets of objects, in order to improve their services (Zhang, et al., 2010).
Some of the available systems that an AMI image can support are OpenSuse Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Debian and Windows Server 2003/2008 32-bit and 64-bit. Security is achieved with passwords, Kerberos tickets or certificates.
Microsoftβ€™s Cloud Services
On the other hand, Microsoft not only provides computing power and storage capacities, but they also offer the ability to their users to access applications that are already developed in the cloud (Zhang, et al., 2010). This is done by Microsoftβ€™s Azure Services Platform which was introduced in 2008 (Sosinsky, 2011).
Windows Azure is a cloud operating system that supports SQL Azure, SharePoint Services, Azure Dynamic CRM, .NET and Microsoft based services. It also consists of a set of virtual machines called β€Computeβ€ and a high capacity storage called β€Storageβ€ (Sosinsky, 2011).
The supported languages on Azure are C#, Visual Basic, C++ (Zhang, et al., 2010). Azure stores the data are stored in blobs, tables and queues. Blobs can have a maximum of 50GB and are saved in tables, different than the SQL-like tables. The language used to access these tables is called Microsoft Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax query language. Data are saved in three different replicas to improve fault tolerance. Like Amazonβ€™s Web Services, the communication in Microsoft Azure is also done via HTTP or HTTPS calls, using REST protocol. However, in comparison with the Amazonβ€™s AMIs, Azureβ€™s users cannot supply their own VM image (The Next Wave, 2009).
Windows Azure also supports Windows Live Services and Windows Live for Mobile applications. The company tries to push software in terms of both applications and services. This way they can benefit of a Microsoft store that sells cloud applications. In addition, .NET has evolved in order to be able to extend parts, or entire applications directly to the cloud. This service is called Azure AppFabric (Sosinsky, 2011).
Part C: Cloud Computing Challenges
As in every new technology that appears, there are challenges associated with Cloud. These can be distinguished in research and commercial aspects.
Challenge in research
One of the main considerations in Cloud Computing research is the actual performance. It is difficult to achieve high performance while writing software for a parallel or distributed system (The Next Wave, 2009). The reason that this happens is the complexity of states and the dependencies between data in applications. Thus, it is hard to predict how many processing power a user needs before executing an application, because this can be achieved only with human interaction and experience (Dillon, et al., 2010).
Moreover, tests have shown that some cloud providers experience network issues, while their VM and shared CPU speeds are relatively fast (Armbrust, et al., 2009). Although it is noticeable that optimizing the network can also improve further a cloudβ€™s performance by reducing congestion and latency, the results produced by a cloud research application might differ due to many unpredictable facts (The Next Wave, 2009).
Since research applications are usually demanding and intensive, they require High Performance Computers (HPC). However, as mentioned above, running such applications on cloud systems cannot ensure that all the threads of a program would run simultaneously through the virtual machines, and this may cause misleading results. This is called performance unpredictability (Armbrust, et al., 2009).
Challenge in commercial adaptation
In addition, there are obstacles regarding the commercial adaption of Cloud Computing. Although using this technology makes it easier and cheaper new companies to enter the market, because of the lower budgetary constraints, there are new security vulnerabilities (Foster, et al., 2008). These security issues raise concerns on whether companies should exclusively shift to cloud technologies.
The most concerning security thread is data breaching, because it might result in an organisationβ€™s sensitive data to be intercepted by their competitors. According to researchers from the University of North Carolina, the University of Wisconsin and RSA Corporation, there is a way to get information about private cryptographic keys being used on any virtual machine that is based on the same physical server (Cloud Security Alliance, 2013).
Moreover, since Cloud Computing provides remote access to the entire userβ€™s information, it becomes crucial to protect this information from hijacking. Such attacks can happen when the users do not protect their credentials and passwords enough, or become victims of phishing and vulnerable exploited software. Damages caused by this attack are data manipulation and eavesdrop on activities. As a result, the userβ€™s application might return false information and redirect to malicious sites (Cloud Security Alliance, 2013).
Another important security thread is the result of insecure interfaces and APIs that are used by Cloud Computing services to provide provisioning, management, orchestration and monitoring. These services are usually enabled by third party organizations resulting in the risk of revealing credentials to these parties. (Cloud Security Alliance, 2013).
Last but not least, the common denial of service attack could not be absent from this new technology. It happens when the victimsβ€™ cloud services are forced to use more of the finite resources (processor power, memory, disk space or network bandwidth) than they actually need. As a result, the cloud services become less efficient and consumers become unsatisfied (Cloud Security Alliance, 2013).
Conclusion
Cloud Computing implements a model that has already become popular, and will remain in use for a long time, because it has many different usages. From individuals, to large companies, users can benefit from its features. However, these benefits also raise new challenges. There is less control over the users, and users do not know where their data are stored. Even though, security risks still exist, there are many researches that focuses on making this technology more efficient and more secure.
